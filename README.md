# Robot Arm Manipulation for Accessibility
The goal of this project is to provide persons who lack fine muscle coordination or who may be missing appendages a more precise extension of their motion through the use of the uArm Swift robotic arm. The finer motion control is obtained through motion tracking of one of the subject's appendages and translating the information to the robot, such that it can perform the motion on a smaller scale. This is a University at Buffalo Robotics research project.
